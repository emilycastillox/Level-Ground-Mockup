## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Since the design is very simple, the initial layout in CSS was not too hard to create. The sections are pretty big, I also made sure to make the page responsive in CSS as well. The overall desing is clean and simple, which I think is useful for many other website templates. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project definitely helped me solidify the concept of creating sections in a layout in CSS and more on how to seamlessly create a responsive design. I hope to incorporate this template into my future projects as well.
